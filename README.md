## 1. Project Title
Lucky Draw Contract

## 2. Project Description
This is a basic Lucky Draw smart contract built in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain.  
It allows users to:
- Enter the lucky draw by paying a fixed entry fee in STX.
- Let the contract owner pick a random winner from the participants list.

## 3. Project Vision
To provide a transparent and decentralized way to run lucky draws or raffles without the need for a centralized authority.  
All rules are enforced on-chain to ensure fairness.

## 4. Future Scope
- Automatically pick a winner using blockchain block hash randomness.
- Support multiple rounds of draws without redeploying the contract.
- Allow multiple prize pools with different entry fees.
- Include a function to distribute the prize to the winner automatically.
